# readme-generator

## Description

My motivation was to create a README Generator that can be used for different projects. I built this project so individuals could utilize one README file and adjust it to a completely different project in an efficient manner. This problem solves saving time on creating a README. I learned how to use logic to meet the criteria associated with writing to a file.
